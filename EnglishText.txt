The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. A sentence contains a group of words that conveys a complete thought. 
It typically starts with a capital letter and ends with a punctuation mark. Words can be composed of letters, 
numbers, or special characters. In natural language processing, 
we often need to preprocess text data by removing non-alphanumeric characters and normalizing it. 
This involves converting the text to lowercase and splitting it into individual words. 
Stop words are common words that do not carry much meaning and are often removed from the text. 
After removing stop words, we can calculate the frequencies of the remaining words and sort them based on their occurrence. 
The resulting word frequency list can provide valuable insights into the most frequent words in the text.
